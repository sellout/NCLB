<<src/NCLB.lisp>>

I lied about there being no “web” file, but you use them very rarely. They are used for document files that aggregate other files in cases where the document format doesn’t support inlining subdocuments. IE, Markdown needs a web file for aggregating, but LaTeχ does not.

The syntax is very simple – it uses the same formatting as the subdocuments, with an added `<<foo/bar.md>>` syntax to include a file at a particular location. With LaTeχ, you would use `\input{foo/bar.tex}` or `\include{foo/bar.tex}` as appropriate, so no web file is necessary there. Even in formats like Markdown, I would recommend using links instead of embedding when possible.

In fact, this file is generated from a web file, so it can pull in documentation from across the system to make a comprehensive README. The reasons for this are

1. [Github](https://github.com/)’s README processing breaks relative links and
2. it avoids having to keep generated versions of all files in the repo, just
   to have the README work.
